# School Game Project
**School Game Project** is a game that we have created as a school project. 
It is written in Python and we used Pygame Framework.

## Important Information

**The program was created as a school project, and so may be unfinished :)**. 

### So, what is it about? 
School game project is game about life in school. You will grow and complete all of the grades in high school (7-13 grade). You will need to win Bosses with help of writing exams, finding pencils or perhaps other treasures. And Using Money you get from combating against your schoolmates. School life isn't easy, and so each new day for you in the game is new year for your character. Not only that but there is a storyline. The story shows school life of innocent individual's (protagonist's) eyes...

### Where do we have our inspiration from?  ðŸ’­
Most heavily we were inspired by such games like Pokemon, because of its unique combat system and Undertale, because of it's story and it's simpleness and yet so interesting and unique game experience.

## Something does not work / I have a Problem (HELP)  ðŸ›Ÿ
If you have a problem, for example something does not work correctly, try to make sure you have python3 installed on your system and configured. You may also need to configure interpreteur for your code editor (it's not hard, but can seem to be confusing at first).
After this everything should be working fine. If not please submit the problem on the Github page, so I could help you :).
