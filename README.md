# School Game Project
**School Game Project** is a game that I with my schoolmates have created as a school project. 
The game is written in Python and we used Pygame "Framework".

## Important Information

**The program was created as a school project, and so may be unfinished :)
New changes will be added, and the game will not be abandoned!**.

### So, what is it about? 
School game project is game about life in school. You will grow and complete all of the grades in high school (7-13 grade). You will need to win Bosses with help of writing exams, finding pencils or perhaps other treasures. And Using Money you get from combating against your schoolmates. School life isn't easy, and so each new day for you in the game is new year for your character. Not only that but there is a storyline. The story shows school life of innocent individual's (protagonist's) eyes... . 
The game is unfinished yet, and so there might be changes in the gameplay and story.

### Where do we have our inspiration from?  ðŸ’­
Most heavily we were inspired by such games like Pokemon, because of its unique combat system and Undertale, because of it's story and it's simpleness and yet so interesting and unique game experience.

# Getting Started 

### Basic Installation
To get started you will need firstly to install python on your OS(Operating System), you are able to find this on the internet, as the process for installing python may be different, depending on your OS.

After that, you will need to install the program. To install the program you have 2 possible ways. One might be easier or better than other, depending on what you want to achieve. I will cover them both.
**Choose one of these options:**
### Getting game to work on your machine [2 ways]

#### 1st Way     <-- [*] preferred way, even if trickier
There are also two ways to install the program 
##### 1. 1st Way - Installing/Cloning Repository/Game
Installing using git clone in the directory of your liking.

To clone in the repository open up a terminal. Change directory to your liking with ( cd ) command.
And write following:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ValentinMENDIss/school-game-project
```

##### 1. 2nd Way - Installing/Cloning Repository/Game
Installing game/Cloning repository using green "Code" button.
    
To install the game/clone repository, press on green "Code" button, and then press on "Download ZIP" button, and choose folder/directory of your liking.

##### 2. Installing Modules/Dependencies
To install dependencies for this game you will need to go to the folder of school-game-project using terminal ( cd ), there you will see requirements.txt. 
Now you will need to write following to install all necessary modules/dependencies with one command, as requirements.txt has information for all of those included.
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
##### 3. Run Program/Game
To run the game, you will need to go to the school-game-project directory/folder, then to code folder/directory using terminal ( cd )-command.
Then just write following command to run the main python script.
```sh
python3 main.py
```

##### Why this method?
Well, even though it is harder to install school-game-project this way, if you download the program using this method, you will get the game with newest version and most recent changes to it.

#### 2nd Way  
##### 1. Installing/Cloning Repository/Game
To install the game press on the right side of the website on Tag icon under heading "Releases", then scroll down util you see a file called something like "school-game-project-v.(some-version).zip" 
Install this file by clicking on it, and choose directory/folder of your liking.
After this

##### 2. Running the game
To run the game, go into the school-game-project folder, then go to the folder "bin", there you will see an executable file "main.exe"(or something similar). Click twice on the executable file to open it.
Now the game should run, enjoy :).

##### Why this method?
This method has some flaws, the game version might be older than the one if you install using 1st method, and if you use this method the game (for now) has only executable for windows (.exe) in "bin" folder.
Despite all this, this method is very good, if you are unfamiliar with terminal, python or in general with programming.

## Something does not work / I have a Problem (HELP)  ðŸ›Ÿ
If you have a problem, for example something does not work correctly, try to make sure you have python3 installed on your system and configured. You may also need to configure interpreteur for your code editor (it's not hard, but can seem to be confusing at first).
After this everything should be working fine. If not please submit the problem on the Github page, so I could help you :).
